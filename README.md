- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jenny2455.
My background is in Chemical Engineering. I joined the coding community 7 months ago and have been teaching myself to code using online resources. I started with Harvard's CS50 class which is mostly taught in C. In that class I also learned Python and SQL fundamentals. 
Iâ€™m currently learning web development following The Odin Project, and going deeper into HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects, if anyone is needing to push off some unwanted tasks to someone else!
